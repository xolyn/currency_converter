# Currency Converter
## Intention
Mature currency converters have been prevail in Chrome extension store for a long time. But in recent use, I found that highly customizable extensions, even for minor changes like converting only selected functionality, are still lacking. This extension can converted selected strings, beginning with a currency symbol into your preferable currencies.

## Installation
1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
2. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
3. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory containing your extension files.

## Usage
1. Select text on web of the following patterns: `^\s*(\$|\ï¿¥)\s*([0-9,]+\s*)+$`
2. Right click to call out context menu
3. Click on "currency converter" to see the result
4. *That's it. Extremely simple to use*
